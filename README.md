# pyfun
There are three files currently.
bf_to_pyf.py converts brainfuck code into pyfun code.
hw.bf is a brainfuck program that outputs Hello World!
hw_pyfun.txt is the pyfun code generated by bf_to_pyf.py with hw.bf as the input
I have also tested bf_to_pyf.py on one of the brainfuck code written by Daniel B. Cristofani and no problems have been found.
If there is any bugs, please report it to me.
